## ⚡ The Manifesto
This isn't a text editor configuration; it's a **Tactical Command Center**. Built by a Gentoo/Guix snob for the sole purpose of maximizing efficiency while minimizing Electron-based brain rot. If you're looking for telemetry, "AI-driven" suggestions, or buttons you can click with a mouse, you've wandered into the wrong repository.

> **Status:** Optimized for Termux / Mobile C2 / Hardened Gentoo environments.

## 🛠️ The Dashboard (Identity Module)
The custom dashboard is designed for high-speed reconnaissance and system management. 

- `[f]` **Fuzzy Finder** — Locate targets in the filesystem at light speed.
- `[g]` **The Lab (Git)** — Direct bridge to `lazygit` for version persistence.
- `[l]` **LFS Book** — Instant access to the Linux From Scratch manual via `lynx`.
- `[c]` **Identity Config** — Self-modification of the `init.lua` source.
- `[n]` **Scan Network** — Launches an `nmap` terminal buffer for active reconnaissance.

## 🚫 The Wall of Shame
```text
+-----------------------+
|       F U C K         |
|      V S  C O D E     |
+-----------------------+
```
If your editor requires more than 50MB of RAM to display a "Hello World" program, it doesn't belong on my hardware.

## 🚀 Deployment
If you think you're worthy of this config, you probably already know how to clone it. If not, stick to your IDE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legendarymsr/legenddots.git ~/.config/nvim
```

*Note: Relative numbers are enabled. If you can't calculate line jumps in your head, don't open the editor.*
