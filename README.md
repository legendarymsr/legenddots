  <em>An elitist, Lua-based identity config built for field operations.</em>

## ⚡ The Manifesto
This isn't a text editor configuration; it's a **Tactical Command Center**. Built by a Gentoo/Guix snob for the sole purpose of maximizing efficiency while minimizing Electron-based brain rot. If you're looking for telemetry, "AI-driven" suggestions, or buttons you can click with a mouse, you've wandered into the wrong repository.

> **Status:** Optimized for Termux / Mobile C2 / Hardened Gentoo environments.

## 🛠️ The Dashboard (Identity Module)
The custom dashboard is designed for high-speed reconnaissance and system management. 

| Key | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[f]` | **Fuzzy Finder** | Locate targets in the filesystem at light speed. |
| `[g]` | **The Lab (Git)** | Direct bridge to `lazygit` for version persistence. |
| `[l]` | **LFS Book** | Instant access to the Linux From Scratch manual via `lynx`. |
| `[c]` | **Identity Config** | Self-modification of the `init.lua` source. |
| `[n]` | **Scan Network** | Launches an `nmap` terminal buffer for active reconnaissance. |

## 🛡️ Technical Specs
- **Engine:** Neovim v0.10+ (Lua-powered)
- **Plugin Manager:** `lazy.nvim` (Minimalist & transactional)
- **Theme:** TokyoNight-Night (Transparent for maximum hacker aesthetic)
- **Mobile Optimization:** Dashboard switches to `doom` theme for stability in high-latency mobile environments.

## 🚫 The Wall of Shame
```text
+-----------------------+
|       F U C K         |
|      V S  C O D E     |
+-----------------------+
```
If your editor requires more than 50MB of RAM to display a "Hello World" program, it doesn't belong on my hardware.

## 🚀 Deployment
If you think you're worthy of this config, you probably already know how to clone it. If not, stick to your IDE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legendarymsr/nvim-dotfiles.git ~/.config/nvim
```

*Note: Relative numbers are enabled. If you can't calculate line jumps in your head, don't open the editor.*
